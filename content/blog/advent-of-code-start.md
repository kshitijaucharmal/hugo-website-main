So I recently came across this website called [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) ([github](https://github.com/kshitijaucharmal/Advent-Of-Code)),
and its awesome!!

It provides you with 2 part puzzles everyday till Christmas, and of course it is Christmas themed.
The questions are structured in a way, where most of the question is related to the premise, and 
the part gives you an example of a sample of the input file you recieve and how it should be solved.
The final answer is a string of characters or numbers, and you get a gold star for completing a part.

I solved 10 questions till now (5 days done).

Where i live, the questions are released by 10:30 in the morning, and I'm in my college till 4PM :(
So I do the questions when i get home, which is late, so I can't get any score, cause the only ones 
that get a score are the top 10 guys.

But still, I loved the questions, as they don't constrain you to use or not use anything, no binding on
which language you use,(I use bash and python), and the questions get tougher everyday (tho the day 4 was too easy).

I encourage you to play it too, cause its amazing!!

[Also, I made a github where I post the answers as soon as I find 'em](https://github.com/kshitijaucharmal/Advent-Of-Code)
